# iScheme: Your Gateway to Every Scheme

## 🎯 Executive Summary
iScheme is a web application created for the [Hackathon Name] hackathon. The core idea is to simplify the process of finding and applying for government welfare schemes. Many citizens are unaware of the schemes they are eligible for, and the information is often scattered across multiple government websites. iScheme solves this problem by providing a single, intuitive platform where a user answers a short questionnaire and receives a personalized list of relevant schemes.

## ✨ Features & Functionality
* **Interactive Questionnaire:** A modern, multi-step questionnaire that guides the user through a series of questions about their demographics (education, state, income, etc.). The interface is built with React and enhanced with animations from Framer Motion for a fluid user experience.
* **Dynamic Eligibility Logic:** The user's answers are processed on the frontend and sent to the backend for eligibility matching. The system will match user data with a predefined set of scheme criteria.
* **Personalized Results Page:** Upon completion, the user is redirected to a results page that displays the data they provided in a clear JSON format. This page serves as a foundation for future iterations that will show a list of eligible schemes.
* **Consistent UI/UX:** The application features a dark, professional theme consistent with a government or institutional service. The styling is managed efficiently with Tailwind CSS.

* **User Authentication:** Implement user sign-up and login to save and track a user's questionnaire results and scheme applications.
* **AI-Powered Assistance:** Add a chatbot that can answer user questions about specific schemes or the application process.
